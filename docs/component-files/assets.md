**File:** `index.css` and `index.js`

If the files should have the same name as the component folder, you can [define that in the config](/configuration/options#files).

_**NOTE:** headman does not actually use these files. That is because headman cannot know which other components are included in your component, hence does not know which other asset files to load additionally. Instead you can add [build files in your config](/configuration/assets) which headman serves._
