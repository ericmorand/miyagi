**File:** `info.json`

```json
{
  "name": "My component",
  "status": "wip"
}
```

## Name

You can give your component a custom name by setting `name` in your `info.json`. If you omit it, the file name is used instead.

## Status

Components can have a status, which is rendered on the [component page](/web-ui/component). Add a `status` key to the mock file of your component with any of the following values:

- `done`
- `wip`
- `needs_work`
