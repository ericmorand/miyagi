To render an introduction on the _overview_ page, you can put a markdown file `docs.md` in your [`components folder`](/configuration/options#components). Its content is rendered at the very top directly below the [`project name`](/configuration/options#projectname).

The _overview_ page renders the base version of every component in your project, to give you an overview of your project. If you did not define base data for any of your components, it renders the first variation.
