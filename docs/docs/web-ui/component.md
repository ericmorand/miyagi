The _component_ page renders

- the content of the component's [documentation file](/component-files/documentation),
- an info section including the actual component path,
- the component's [schema](/component-files/schema), [mock data](/component-files/mocks) and [template](/component-files/template),
- all variants including the validation status of the mock file as well as the compiled mock data.
